* Notes and chords are the building blocks of the language of music.

music theory is important:
1. communicate with others
2. understand music
3. compose music
4. change instrument


* music definition.
generic:
music is the art, the craft, and the science of organizing sound and silence in the framwork of time.
specific:
music is a succession of tones arranged in a specific rhythm.


pitch: discribe the specific frequency of a sound.
tone: a sound that is played or sung at a specific pitch.


A: 440Hz




* music notation evolution(Mary had a little lamb)
** 1. by frequency
[[file:frequency.png]]

** 2. by number(relative)
[[file:number.png]]

** 3. by Solfege(sol-FEZH, relative)
[[file:solfege.png]]

(tone have value: like frequency, number, solfege)
(tone have name: ABCDEFG)

** 4. by staff

so -> staff

staff: composed of lines and spaces
[[file:blank-staff.png]]
(each line or space represents a specific pitch)
(the pitches are determined by the clef at the beginning of the staff)


* different clefs
** treble clef

** bass clef

remeber:
Good Boys Do Fine Always

** grand staff

** alto clef

** tenor clef

** octave clef

up(if the 8 is above the clef) an octave
down(if the 8 is below the clef) an octave

* interval
distance between pitches

* sharp flat and natural sign
[[file:sharp-flat.png]]
* step
the smallest interval in Western music is the half step.


* degree
because of the disadvantage of the step method to describe the intervals between two notes.
--> degree(relative numbering method)

[[file:degree.png]]

[[file:basic-interval-starting-on-c.png]]

* major and minor intervals
When measuring by degrees, 
you see that the second, third, sixth, and seventh notes can be easily flattened. 
When you flatten one of these notes, you create what is called a minor interval. 
The natural state of these intervals (in a major scale) is called a major interval.

* perfect intervals
Certain intervals don’t have separate major or minor states (although they can still be flattened or sharpened). 
These intervals—fourths, fifths, and octaves— exist in one form only, called a perfect interval. 

perfect fifth: 3:2
perfect fourth: 4:3

* augmented and diminished intervals
When you raise a per- fect interval a half step, 
it’s called an augmented interval. 
When you lower a per- fect interval a half step, 
it’s called a diminished interval. 
So don’t call the new intervals major or minor—call them augmented or diminished.

* scale
eight successive pitches within a one-octave range.
All scales start on one note and end on that same note one octave higher.

* major scale
happy scale.
What makes a major scale major are the specific intervals between the notes of the scale. 

(whole whole half whole whole whole half)

C Major is the only major scale that use only the white keys.



* enharmonic
two notes that are identical, but spelled differently.
like, G-sharp and G-flat

* chromatic and diatonic
Any notes you play outside the scale are called chromatic notes; 
notes within the scale are said to be diatonic.

* minor scales
the third note is a minor interval.

** natural minor

(whole half whole whole half whole whole)

** harmonic minor scale

(whole half whole whole half whole-and-a-half half)

** melodic minor scale

(whole half whole whole whole whole half)


* key
When a piece of music is based on a particular musical scale, 
we say that music is in the “key” of that scale. 
For example, a song based around the C Major scale is in the key of C Major. 

* key signature
You designate a key by inserting a key signature at the very start of the music, next to the first clef on the first staff. 
This key signature indicates the sharps and flats used in that particular key. 
Then, when you play through the entire piece, you automatically sharpen and flatten the appropriate notes.

* accident
When you decide to write a note that isn’t within the current key, you have to manually indicate the change in the music—by using sharp, flat, or natural signs. 
These “outside the key” notes are called accidentals or chromatic notes;

* modulating
When you change keys in the middle of a song, it’s called modulating to another key. 
[[file:modulating.png]]

* rhythm
time.
drives the music forward and gives it its beat.

* measure
in songs based around groups of four, each group of four beats is called a measure.

* taking count
