\label{cha:full-conn-netw}

A fully connected neural network consists of a series of fully connected layers that connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the other layer.
Full connected neural network layers use matrix multiplication by a matrix of parameters with a separate parameter describing the interaction between each input unit and each output unit.
This means that every output unit interacts with every input unit.


Figure \ref{fig:fc} show the full connects neural network.
