\chapter{What is \LaTeX}

\LaTeX is a document markup language. It separate format from content.



\section{Reason to Use It}
Because \LaTeX \xspace{} is a markup language, you should learn it before you can use it.
So why should you spend so much time to learn it while there is so much document creator like Word, Pages?

There is several reasons that push me to select it.

\subsection{\LaTeX is Pouerful}
\label{sec:latex-pouerful}

\LaTeX provides powerful edit ability. You can almost get whatever you want to show, especially the mathematical equations. Other document editor is less powerful in equations editing.

\subsection{It is Easier to Alter Format}
\label{sec:it-easier-alter}

Because \LaTeX \xspace{} separate the format and the content, it is easy to do format alteration in the full document domain, for example change the style of the chapter.

\subsection{One for All}
\label{sec:one-all}

Once you create your own template, it is easy to wreate document with the template applied, saving so much time in format. The disadvantage is that you spend more time in the first time.
