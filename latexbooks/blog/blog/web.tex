\section{Common Header and Footer}

In developing my blog, there is a need to write common headers and footer for all the index pages.
At first, I copy the common header and footer to every index page, because there are only 5 index pages in my blog.
But soon I find the weakness this method.
If I change the header or footer, I need to copy them every again.
It's time consuming and error prone.

Here is another method I take.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Extract the header and footer into separate file, say \verb|header.html| and \verb|footer.html|.
\item use the code \verb|{% include header.html %}| to include the html file where you want to include the html episode.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{tcolorbox}
  Note:
  The \verb|header.html| and the \verb|footer.html| does not contain the all html attributes.
  It is just the episode of the index page.
\end{tcolorbox}
