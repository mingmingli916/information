\chapter{Authentication in request}

Django uses sessions and middleware to hook the authentication system into request objects.

These provide a request.user attribute on every request which represents the current user.
If the current user has not logged in, this attribute will be set to an instance of AnonymousUser, otherwise it will be an instance of User.

You can tell them apart with is_authenticated, like so:

\begin{lstlisting}
if request.user.is_authenticated:
    # Do something for authenticated users.
    ...
else:
    # Do something for anonymous users.
    ...  
\end{lstlisting}
