Good morning, Thank you for giving me this wonderful opportunity to introduce myself to you. My name is Mingming Li and I'm a deep learning algorithm engineer.

My current job have two parts: 
the first part is paper searching for a denosing model, Encoder-Decoder model, fine-tuning the model and applying the trained model into docoment denosing operation.
The second part is paper searching for an object detection model, SSD, fine-tuning the model and applying the trained model into the document cut operation.
The AI model improve the document processing efficiency by 80%.

I am competent for this job. In my part time, I read the book "deep learning" written by Goodfellow and got a solid understanding on deep learning theory.
After learning Python systematically, I practice my coding ability with Python a lot in my job.
The process of my current job is paper searing, model fine-tuning, and applying models into practice which I think matches this position well.

That's all, thank you for you time.
