\href{https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/}{Flask} is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
It provides a solid core with the basic services, while extensions provides the rest.
Flask has three main dependencies.
The routing, debugging, and Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) subsystems come from Werkzeug; the template support is provided by Jinja2; and the command-line integration comes from Click.

The easy way to install Flask is with the Python package manager \keyword{pip}.
