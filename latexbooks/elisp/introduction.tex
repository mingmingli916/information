Most of the GNU macs text editor is written in the programming language called Emacs Lisp.
It is useful to do \keyword{customization} and \keyword{extension} to Emacs.

\section{History}
\label{sec:history}

Lisp (LISt Processing language) was first developed in the late 1950s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for research in artificial intelligence.


Dozens of Lisp implementations have been built over the years, each with its own idiosyncrasies.
Many of them were inspired by Maclisp, which was written in the 1960s at MITâ€™s Project MAC.
Eventually the implementers of the descendants of Maclisp came together and developed a standard for Lisp systems, called Common Lisp.

GNU Emacs Lisp is largely inspired by Maclisp, and a little by Common Lisp.
