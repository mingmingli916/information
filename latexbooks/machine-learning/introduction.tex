At the start of the artificial intelligence, a set of rules was written to do some computationally intensive work.
At this time, it is called \keyword{knowledge base}.

Some tasks to difficult for human to write the set of rule to consider all the situations.
It involved to learn from data.
Human first extract features from raw data and computer extract patterns from features.
At this time, it is called \keyword{machine learning}.


For some tasks, for example image classification, face recognition, it is difficult to extract features.
We let computer learn extracting features and patterns from raw data.
For example, in image classification, it first extract line features.
From the line features, it extract shape features.
From the shape features, it extract more abstract features, like object features.
In patterns extracting process, it reduce the dimension gradually to the classes.
Considering the whole processing units, it is very deep.
At this time, it is called \keyword{deep learning}.
