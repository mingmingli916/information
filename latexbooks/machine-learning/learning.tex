\label{cha:learning}

A machine learning algorithm is an algorithm that is able to learn from data.
But what do we mean by learning?
Mitchell provides a succinct definition:
``A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$''


Now, how does the learn happen?
The model or algorithm learns by adjusting the parameters contained in it.

How to adjust the parameters?
Refer to Chapter \ref{cha:training}.
