There are 3 ways to make your module accessable to you:
1. place it in your path path (like /home/hack/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages)
2. place it in the current directory where you execute your python script
3. define a environment variable PYTHONPYTH referring to your moddule path

In PyCharm, add your module to project interpreter:

1. Open the setting
[[file:pics/charm1.png]]

2. Show all
[[file:pics/charm2.png]] 

3. Show paths for the selected interpreter
[[file:pics/charm3.png]]

4. Add your module path
[[file:pics/charm4.png]]
