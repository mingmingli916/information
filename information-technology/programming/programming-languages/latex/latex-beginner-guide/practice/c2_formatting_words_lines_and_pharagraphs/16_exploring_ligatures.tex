\section{What's this?}
This   is   our second document.

It contains two paragraphs. The first line of a paragraph will be
indented, but not when it follows a heading.

%% If the letter i follows the letter f, the dot of the letter i could collide with the head of the f. It
%% could be avoided in two ways: either by increasing the space between those two letters or by
%% combining them. The latter will result in a ligature. This will automatically be done by LaTeX
%% when the used font provides such ligatures.

%% Curly braces can be used to achieve the same effect. For instance, in -{}- and {-}{-} , the
%% dashes cannot be joined because this would cross group boundaries.

%% completely suppressing ligatures could be
%% done easily by passing the option noligatures to the microtype package:
%% \usepackage[noligatures]{microtype}.

%% spaces separate words, empty lines separate paragraphs.
