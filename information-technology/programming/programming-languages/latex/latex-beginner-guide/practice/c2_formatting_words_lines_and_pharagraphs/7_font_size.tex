%% There are no corresponding commands taking arguments.

%% The actual resulting font size depends on the base font. If your document has a base font of 12 pt, then \tiny would result in text bigger than with a base font of 10 pt.

%% Normally, font size declarations are used only in definitions of macros in the preamble, just as it does apply to the other font commands.
