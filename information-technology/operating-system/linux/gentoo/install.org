* Architectures
 An architecutre is a family of CPUs who support the same instructions.
 The two most prominent architecutres in the desktop world are the x86 and the x86_64 (amd64)
 
amd64:
Intel Pentium 4, Core2, Core i3, i5, i7


X86 is a 32-bit architecutre 

* Stage
A stage3 tarbal is an archive containing a minumal Gentoo environment, suitable to continue the Gentoo installation.

* Mirror File Location
copy the link in the download page, find the same path in the mirror.


* Booting
uefi secure boot off

** bios, uefi, secure boot
*** bios: basic input output system
BIOS is non-volatile firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first software to run when powered on.

*** uefi: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
The  UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware.

*** secure boot
Secure Boot只是UEFI的一个部分。两者的关系是局部与整体的关系。

Secure Boot的目的，是防止恶意软件侵入。它的做法就是采用密钥。UEFI规定，主板出厂的时候，可以内置一些可靠的公钥。然后，任何想要在这块主板上加载的操作系统或者硬件驱动程序，都必须通过这些公钥的认证。也就是说，这些软件必须用对应的私钥签署过，否则主板拒绝加载。由于恶意软件不可能通过认证，因此就没有办法感染Boot。


** wireless
ifconfig

*** wpa
Wi-Fi protected access
*** wep
wep: wired Equivalent Privacy


*** three ways of configuring wifi
graphical client
text-mode interface
command-line interface

*** three tools to support command-line driven wireless configurtion
net-wireless/iw
net-wireless/wireless-tools
net-wireless/wpa_supplicant

The net-wireless/iw software, the successor of net-wireless/wireless-tools, supports nearly all cards and drivers, but it cannot connect to WPA-only Access Points. If the networks only offer WEP encryption or are completely open, then net-wireless/iw beats the other package over simplicity.

command: rfkill --help

***  wpa_supplicant
vi  /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
    # The below line not be changed otherwise wpa_supplicant refuses to work
    ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
  
    # Ensure that only root can read the WPA configuration
    ctrl_interface_group=0
  
    # Let wpa_supplicant take care of scanning and AP selection
    ap_scan=1
  
    # Simple case: WPA-PSK, PSK as an ASCII passphrase, allow all valid ciphers
    network={
      ssid="qfy"
      psk="lllgyn66"
      # The higher the priority the sooner we are matched
      priority=5
      }


* Block Device
SCSI and Serial ATA drives are both labeled /dev/sd*

The block devices /dev/sd* represent an abstract interface to the disk.

* Partition Tables
Disk block devices are split up into smaller, more manageable block devices, called partitions.

two standard partitioning technology:
** MBR
MBR: Master Boot Record

The MBR setup uses 32-bit identifiers for the start sector and length of the partitions.
support 3 partition types: primary, extended, logical.

Primary partitions have their information stored in the master boot record itself - a very small (usually 512 bytes) location at the very beginning of a disk. Due to this small space, only four primary partitions are supported (for instance, /dev/sda1 to /dev/sda4).

** GPT
GPT: GUID Parition Table
GUID: Globally Unique IDentifier

The GPT setup uses 64-bit identifiers for the partitions.

ESP: EFI System Partition


** LVM
LVM: Logical Volum Manager
LVM increases the flexibility offered by the partiting setup.
